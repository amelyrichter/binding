# Binding
This is the third project in our Typography and Interaction 01 course at Parsons, Fall 2024.
It explores three different articles that pose the question: What makes "good design" actually good, and when do we consider something "bad design"?
The typography and color express this concept by distorting the words in various ways. Enjoy!
